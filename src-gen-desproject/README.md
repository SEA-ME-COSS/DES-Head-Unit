# src-gen codes

The files in this directory are generated based on the .fidl and .fdepl files in the "fidl" folder. These codes are utilized to enable processes to engage in vsomeip communication as either a service or a client.


Take note of how these codes are included and used in the source code. Also, pay attention to their inclusion in the CMakeLists.

If you want to understand the specifics of generating these codes, please refer to the "fidl" folder.
